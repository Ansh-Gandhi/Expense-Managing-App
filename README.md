# Expense Managing Web App

- Developed a full-stack expense management application that allows users to create groups, add shared expenses, and view real-time balances to simplify cost-splitting between individuals or groups

- Designed and built a responsive and intuitive front-end using **Next.js**, ensuring seamless navigation across mobile and desktop devices

- Integrated **Clerk** for secure user authentication and **OAuth**, enabling smooth sign-up and login flows with providers like Google

- Utilized **Convex** as the backend database and API layer to handle real-time updates for users, groups, and expenses, ensuring consistent and synchronized state across all connected clients

- Integrated **Inngest** to schedule automated cron jobs for background tasks such as sending payment reminders and updating group summaries at regular intervals
